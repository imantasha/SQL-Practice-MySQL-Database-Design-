# SQL Practice -- MySQL & Database Design 

This repository contains all SQL queries I practiced while completing
the\
**"SQL for Beginners: Learn SQL using MySQL & Database Design"** course
by Scaler Topics.

The queries cover SQL fundamentals, pattern matching, joins, subqueries,
grouping, and real-world scenarios using the ClassicModels sample
database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics Covered

### 1. Basic SELECT & Filtering

``` sql
SELECT * FROM classicmodels.employees;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE officeCode = 1 ORDER BY firstName;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE officeCode IN (1,2,4);
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE officeCode NOT IN (1,2,4);
```

### 2. BETWEEN Operator

``` sql
SELECT * FROM payments 
WHERE paymentDate BETWEEN '2003-06-05' AND '2004-06-05';
```

### 3. LIKE Operator (Pattern Matching)

``` sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle LIKE "%SALE%";
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstName LIKE "%y";
```

### 4. REGEXP (Regular Expressions)

``` sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP "^SALE";
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP "rep$";
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstName REGEXP "^a|^b";
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstName REGEXP "^[abcdf]";
```

### 5. Joins (Inner, Outer, Self, Explicit & Implicit)

**Inner Join**

``` sql
SELECT payments.customerNumber, customerName, paymentDate, amount 
FROM payments 
JOIN customers ON payments.customerNumber = customers.customerNumber;
```

**Multiple Joins**

``` sql
SELECT orderNumber, status, o.customerNumber, c.customerName,
       e.firstName AS "SALES PERSON NAME", e.jobTitle
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
JOIN employees e ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber;
```

**Self Join**

``` sql
SELECT emp.employeeNumber, emp.firstName, emp.jobTitle,
       mgr.firstName AS "Manager Name", mgr.jobTitle AS "Manager Title"
FROM employees emp  
JOIN employees mgr;
```

**Explicit Join Syntax**

``` sql
SELECT p.customerNumber, paymentDate, amount, customerName 
FROM payments p 
INNER JOIN customers c ON p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber;
```

**Implicit Join Syntax**

``` sql
SELECT p.customerNumber, paymentDate, amount, customerName 
FROM payments p, customers c 
WHERE p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber;
```

### 6. Outer Join (LEFT JOIN)

``` sql
SELECT c.customerNumber, customerName, o.orderNumber 
FROM customers c 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber;
```

### 7. USING Keyword

``` sql
SELECT c.customerNumber, customerName, o.orderNumber 
FROM customers c 
JOIN orders o USING (customerNumber);
```

### 8. GROUP BY & Aggregate Functions

``` sql
SELECT productLine, COUNT(*) AS productCount 
FROM products 
GROUP BY productLine;
```

**Employees per office**

``` sql
SELECT officeCode, city, state, COUNT(employeeNumber) AS employeeCnt 
FROM employees 
JOIN offices USING (officeCode)
GROUP BY officeCode;
```

### 9. HAVING Clause

``` sql
SELECT officeCode, city, state, COUNT(employeeNumber) AS employeeCnt 
FROM employees 
JOIN offices USING (officeCode)
GROUP BY officeCode 
HAVING employeeCnt > 4;
```

**Countries with more than 20 orders**

``` sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS totalOrders
FROM orders 
JOIN customers USING(customerNumber)
GROUP BY country
HAVING totalOrders > 20;
```

### 10. Subqueries

**Products with the same product line**

``` sql
SELECT productName 
FROM products 
WHERE productLine = (
    SELECT productLine 
    FROM products 
    WHERE productName = "1917 Grand Touring Sedan"
);
```

**Cars costlier than another product**

``` sql
SELECT * 
FROM products  
WHERE productLine REGEXP "cars"
AND MSRP > (
    SELECT MSRP 
    FROM products 
    WHERE productName = "1936 Mercedes-Benz 500K Special Roadster"
);
```

**Customers who never placed orders**

``` sql
SELECT customerNumber 
FROM customers 
WHERE customerNumber NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT customerNumber FROM orders
);
```

**Same using LEFT JOIN**

``` sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
LEFT JOIN orders USING (customerNumber) 
WHERE orderNumber IS NULL;
```
